This is a new file that clearly explains the each.key and each.value meta arguments in terraform
This readme.md explains this concept topically

Terraform will perform the following actions:

Plan: 3 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy

This is the output when this code : 

resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  for_each = toset(var.vpc_cidr)
  cidr_block = each.value
  instance_tenancy = "default"

  tags = {
    Name = "main"
  }
}
